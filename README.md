RADAR is a generalist vision-language model trained on over 400,000 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT examinations with 15 million anatomy-aware image–text pairs, learning directly from clinical reports without manual annotation. RADAR provides a scalable and versatile framework for radiology AI, demonstrating expert-level performance across both routine and complex clinical tasks.

## Setup

Create a conda environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n radar python=3.10
conda activate radar
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## HuggingFace

- The pre-trained checkpoints and supporting files are available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/radar-generalist).
- For convenience, we have provided the demo nifty, processed Merlin-related reports and labels, and predicted results in CSV format in this repo. The supporting files required for the inference demo and training can be downloaded from HuggingFace.
