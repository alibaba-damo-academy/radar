# RADAR: An Expert-Level Generalist AI for Abdominal CT Diagnosis

Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology aspires to deliver expert-level diagnosis across diverse clinical tasks, yet existing supervised strategies remain limited in scope. We developed **RADAR**, a generalist vision–language model trained on more than **400,000** contrast-enhanced abdominal CT examinations and **15 million** anatomy-wise image–text pairs, learning directly from clinical reports without manual annotation. Across extensive internal and external evaluations spanning multiple centers and varied scenarios, RADAR achieved high diagnostic performance and robust generalization for **18 anatomical structures** and **146 imaging findings**. In a reader study, AI assistance increased the diagnostic sensitivity of 26 radiologists by approximately 10%, underscoring its clinical utility. In summary, RADAR offers a scalable, versatile, and interpretable solution, demonstrating that generalist AI can match human experts in both routine and complex radiology tasks.

## HuggingFace

- The pre-trained checkpoints and supports files are available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/radar-generalist).
- For convenience, we have provided the demo nifty, processed merlin-related reports and labels, predicted results in csv format in this repo. The supporting files required for inferecnce demo and training can be downloaded from HuggingFace.
